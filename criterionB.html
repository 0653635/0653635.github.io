    <p><em>The final chosen design and justify its selection.</em></p>
    <p>The final design of the robot consisted of a four wheeled robot that contained a claw in the front and an ultrasonic sensor mounted in the middle. Moreover, there was one colour sensor along the side of the robot. Note all of these parts were provided by the Lego Mindstorms Ev3 Pack.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The robot had a rectangular chassis so it was rigid and stable. There was an issue concerning stability because we were unsure whether the robot was able to handle the combined weight of the motors, sensor and the claw.</li>
      <li>Four wheels were used because that is that ideal number of wheels for supporting a rectangular body.</li>
      <li>Four motors were used so the robot could handle the combined weight of EV3 brick, gripper, ultrasonic and distance sensor when turning, stopping and accelerating.</li>
      <li>A claw was placed in the front of the robot because it is easier to collect any obstructing objects.</li>
      <li>An ultrasonic sensor was used to detect objects that are obstructing its path. The ultrasonic sensor was mounted on the middle of the robot so it is able to scan a greater area. The ultrasonic sensor was also placed so the mass of the robot could be equally distributed, allowing for easier movement. </li>
      <li>A colour sensor was used so the line could be detected. The colour sensor allows the robot to follow the line, turn and stop when designated./li>
