    <p><em>Design detailed and relevant testing methods, which generate data, to measure the success of the solution.</em></p>
    <p>To evaluate the success of the robot, a survey, in the format of a google form, was created for the Year 9/10 Computer Science Class. The survey consisted of two sections that asked about the status of the robot and webpage. The first section about the robot covered questions about whether the robot could follow a line, turn and stop at a designated point. These questions were asked in order to ensure that the robot works towards or achieves the Australian Curriculum requirements. For these questions, the answers were given in a “Yes”, “No” and “Maybe” format. The final questions in the section asked about the overall design of the robot and the overall innovation of the robot. The questions asked users to provide a rating between 1-5. At the end of the section, there was an optional section that asked participants to provide an open-ended response about any additional feedback about the robot. The second section addressed the webpage. One question in the section asked whether the website fulfilled its purpose in presenting the project, in the format of “Yes”, “No” and “Maybe”. The final questions of the section asked the user to provide a rating between 1-5 about the navigation system, formatting and the color scheme.</p>

    <p><em>Explain how the solution could be improved.</em></p>
    <p>One possible improvement to the solution would be to construct the robot using popular and more advanced robotics templates, such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi. This would benefit the solution because the Arduino and Raspberry Pi have greater capabilities than Mindstorm Ev3s. For instance, Arduino boards are able to control numerous motors at once. Furthermore, the electrical circuits can be easily mounted using glue and an acrylic sheet, and as a result this structure is more rigid compared to the lego structure.</p>
    <p>Motors that are compatible with Arduino are more powerful than the motors compatible with Mindstorm Ev3s. Powerful motors benefit the robot because problems regarding turning while supporting the heavy weight of the robot will be eliminated. Moreover, the motors that are compatible with Arduino are powerful and lightweight compared to the motors compatible with Mindstorm Ev3s. Using an Arduino would have allowed a more complex arm, like one that is able to move up, down, left and right. In particular, servo motors are highly effective when creating arms that are able to rotate 360 degrees.</p>

    <p><em>Explain the impact of the solution on the client/target audience.</em></p>
    <p>Our solution was aimed at our peers and the wider scientific community for the purpose of educating about the importance of the upcoming fourth industrial revolution which will in turn affect future job opportunities. In particular we have approached our project in the hope of exploring how further knowledge of computer science and robotics can be applied to the field of autonomous cars. This is evident from our final product, which was able to display our sound comprehension of complex computer science and robotics principles. Our final product was able to meet all guidelines. For instance, it was able to follow a line, turn and stop when designated. Furthermore, in our introduction, we have cited various applications and implications of computer science and robotics on our future. Our report has cited various medical and agricultural robotics applications, whilst considering the implications these technologies will have on the years ahead. In addition, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the economic factors associated with the growth of robotics in the industrial landscape yielding both positive and negative results. This leads to the belief that the contribution to robotics to worldwide growth will be significant.</p>
