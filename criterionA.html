    <p><em>Explain and justify the need for a solution to a problem for a specified client/target audience.</em></p>
    <p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution is a major historical period for modern humanity. It involves the autonomisation and increased interconnectivity of digital machines across physical, digital and biological spheres (Schwab, 2016). One of the emerging and essential disciplines during the fourth industrial revolution is robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). Robotics and AI have already been impacting various industries, such as agriculture and hospitality by improving work efficiency and allowing thousands of human jobs to vanish, bringing about a problem in socioeconomic inequality.</p>
    <p>Robotics is bound to impact the Fourth Industrial Revolution through its various applications in the agricultural industry. By 2050, the global population is expected to grow to 9.7 billion (United Nations, 2018). To meet this unprecedented demand and also supply nutritional food, global agricultural production must increase by 70% from current levels (Ku, 2019). Hence, these statistics outline the need for farmers to develop effective and efficient farming methods which will meet these future demands. Robotics and associated technologies represent an excellent candidate to fill this predicament. In fact robotics has already successfully been integrated into farming, Agrobot has developed the first robot to harvest strawberries, regardless of where and when they are grown. These strawberry-picking robots are able to harvest around twenty-acres of fruit in three days, and are set for commercial use by the end of 2020 (Zitter, 2019). Moreover, some companies have developed autonomous tractors or remotely controlled tractors. The impact of the use of these technologies on the fourth industrial revolution is that greater yield is generated, compared to human workers. </p>

    <p>The widespread application of robotics in the Fourth Industrial Revolution has a significant impact on the employees whose jobs are replaced by robots. It is estimated that robots are to replace up to 20 million factory jobs by 2030 (Cellan-Jones, 2019). This figure is concerning because it increases income inequality, and further widens the gap between the rich and the poor. The large role which robots play in the fourth industrial revolution raises important ethical questions and ideas about the impact of robots in our future.</p>
    <p>The integration of Robotics in the field of medicine has occurred and is already making a significant impact. In hospitals, the establishment of robotics in surgery is especially significant, considering that 250,000 to 400,000 deaths per year are due to medical errors (Mackary, Daniel, 2016). This is because surgeons are routinely asked to perform various precise and dangerous procedures when they are susceptible to human error and limitation. The da Vinci Surgical Robot is a great example of how robotics can be successfully implemented to reduce these human errors. The Da Vinci surgical robot is a robotic surgical system which is designed to facilitate surgery using a minimally invasive approach. The surgical system is controlled by a surgeon from a console which translates the surgeon’s hand movements in real time, bending and rotating the instruments while performing the procedure. The system utilises a set of advanced instruments which move similar to a human hand, but with a greater range of motion. The da Vinci vision system also delivers highly magnified, 3D high-definition views of the surgical area. Additionally, the size of the instrument makes it possible for surgeons to operate through one or a few small incisions (Intuitive, 2020). This advanced technology allows the surgeon to achieve results which provide improved outcomes for the patient. For example, the number of complications associated with hysterectomy for benign conditions were consistently reduced when the Da Vinci surgical robot was used as the primary surgical tool. Hence, minimally invasive surgery with da Vinci is widely used in urology and gynecology procedures.</p>
