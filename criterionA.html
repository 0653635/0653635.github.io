    <p><em>Explain and justify the need for a solution to a problem for a specified client/target audience.</em></p>
    <p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution is a major historical period for modern humanity. It involves the autonomisation and increased interconnectivity of digital machines across physical, digital and biological spheres (Schwab, 2016). One of the emerging and essential disciplines during the fourth industrial revolution is robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). Robotics and AI have already been impacting various industries, such as agriculture and hospitality by improving work efficiency and allowing thousands of human jobs to vanish, bringing about a problem in socioeconomic inequality.</p>
    <p>Robotics is bound to impact the Fourth Industrial Revolution through its various applications in the agricultural industry. By 2050, the global population is expected to grow to 9.7 billion (United Nations, 2018). To meet this unprecedented demand and also supply nutritional food, global agricultural production must increase by 70% from current levels (Ku, 2019). Hence, these statistics outline the need for farmers to develop effective and efficient farming methods which will meet these future demands. Robotics and associated technologies represent an excellent candidate to fill this predicament. In fact robotics has already successfully been integrated into farming, Agrobot has developed the first robot to harvest strawberries, regardless of where and when they are grown. These strawberry-picking robots are able to harvest around twenty-acres of fruit in three days, and are set for commercial use by the end of 2020 (Zitter, 2019). Moreover, some companies have developed autonomous tractors or remotely controlled tractors. The impact of the use of these technologies on the fourth industrial revolution is that greater yield is generated, compared to human workers. This will allow farmers and maximise profits for farmers and manufacturers.</p>

    <p>The widespread application of robotics in the Fourth Industrial Revolution has a significant impact on the employees whose jobs are replaced by robots. It is estimated that robots are to replace up to 20 million factory jobs by 2030 (Cellan-Jones, 2019). This figure is concerning because it increases income inequality, and further widens the gap between the rich and the poor. However, although jobs will decrease, it is estimated that by 2030, robotization would boost the global GDP by 5.3%, which equates to adding 4.9 trillion to the global economy (Taylor, 2019).</p>
    <p>The integration of Robotics in the field of medicine has occurred and is already making a significant impact. In hospitals, the establishment of robotics in surgery is especially significant, considering that 250,000 to 400,000 deaths per year are due to medical errors (Mackary, Daniel, 2016). This is because surgeons are routinely asked to perform various precise and dangerous procedures when they are susceptible to human error and limitation. The da Vinci Surgical Robot is a great example of how robotics can be successfully implemented to reduce these human errors. The Da Vinci surgical robot is a robotic surgical system which is designed to facilitate surgery using a minimally invasive approach. The surgical system is controlled by a surgeon from a console which translates the surgeon’s hand movements in real time, bending and rotating the instruments while performing the procedure. The system utilises a set of advanced instruments which move similar to a human hand, but with a greater range of motion. The da Vinci vision system also delivers highly magnified, 3D high-definition views of the surgical area. Additionally, the size of the instrument makes it possible for surgeons to operate through one or a few small incisions (Intuitive, 2020). This advanced technology allows the surgeon to achieve results which provide improved outcomes for the patient. For example, the number of complications associated with hysterectomy for benign conditions were consistently reduced when the Da Vinci surgical robot was used as the primary surgical tool. Hence, minimally invasive surgery with da Vinci is widely used in urology and gynecology procedures.</p>

    <p>There is a distinct relationship between industrial robots and economic outcomes across the developed and developing world. The increased use of industrial robots is associated with increases in labor productivity. This is evident as the contribution of increased use of robots to productivity growth is substantial and comes to 0.36 percentage points, accounting for 15% of the aggregate economy-wide productivity growth (Graetz, Michaels, 2018). Additionally, robot densification is associated with increases in both total factor productivity and wages, and reductions in output prices. Interestingly, according to research done by MIT, there seems to be no significant relationship between the increased use of industrial robots and overall employment, although the report notes that robots may be reducing the employment of low-skilled workers (Graetz, Michaels, 2018). The substantial growth of the robotics market is apparent when considering that as of 2007, industrial robots accounted for only around 2.25% of the capital stock in robot-using industries, and their use was relatively limited, even in developed economies. However, If the quality-adjusted prices of robots keep falling at a rate similar to that observed over the past decades, and as new applications are developed, Robotics should continue to increase labor productivity. Recently, the development of robots has been increasingly directed toward services. Areas that are experiencing particularly rapid expansions include medical robots, factory logistic systems, and unmanned aerial vehicles, popularly known as drones (IFR, 2012).</p>
    <p>Another area where autonomous machines hold both promise and threat to jobs is self-driving vehicles. Considering that if and when they become commercially viable, self-driving cars offer a more convenient, more flexible, and safer mode of transportation. At the same time, they pose a threat to the employment of drivers with few recognized qualifications, including many immigrants from less developed countries. Recent evidence (Financial Times, 2014; IFR, 2014) shows that robots are increasingly used also in developing countries, and China is already the world’s leading buyer of robots. This leads one to believe that the contribution of robots to world-wide growth in the upcoming decades will be significant. At the same time, the evidence suggests that marginal returns on increased robot densification seem to diminish fairly rapidly. However, it should be noted that the rise of robots is not a blessing for all: considering  that low-skilled workers in particular are at risk of losing their jobs.</p>

    <p>As robotics continues to have a significant impact on industries, important ethical and moral dilemmas have been raised regarding current and future integration of robots, especially with the use of artificially intelligent robots. For example, should robots share the same rights as humans? What differentiates a robot from a human? and whether robots are a threat to privacy. The European Parliament has created laws holding robots accountable and regulating developers during safety-related incidents. Furthermore, the United States courts have claimed that the actions of robots must strictly be defined, and that developers should be held accountable during work-related incidents.</p>
    <p>Homepods, such as Amazon’s “Alexa” and “Google Home”, are able to monitor activities in the home surroundings. Despite their benefits around the home, issues concerning privacy include the homepods being able to observe private conversations and have access to every room. To address this issue, laws will need to be developed to prevent the misuse of public data by robots. Moreover, robot manufacturers must develop policies regarding their use of public data, as without public trust robot development will stagnate (Spofford, 2018).</p>
